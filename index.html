            <h3>Locally Owned Midland Coffee Shops: A Guide from a Coffee-Obsessed College Student</h3>
            <author>Faye Kollig</author>
            <date>October 9, 2020</date>
            <p><em>This is not a comprehensive list! I know I'm missing someone (Higher Grounds, Coffee Chaos, Crepes et Amis), but these are the cafes
                I have frequented enough to provide a review.</em> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://grovetealounge.com/"><b>Grove Tea Lounge</b></a> is a Christian-owned business near Dow Chemical, 
                        selling food, pastry, coffee, and an extensive amount of tea. They're known for being involved with other
                        local businesses, their creative, vegan and gluten-free doughnuts and pastries, and for their outdoor seating.
                        It's important to note that they're pricy. Their food in particular does not seem worth the price, 
                        and their espresso tends to be far too sweet. Their location is ALWAYS cold, so make sure to layer up if 
                        you go; but if you don't mind cold and mochas that taste like chocolate milk, the wifi is good,
                        the staff is friendly, and there's always plenty of space and parking. They also have a drive-through!</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.liveoakcoffeehouse.com/"><b>Live Oak Coffeehosue</b></a> is where I'm sitting as I write
                        this - in terms of ambience, decor, and friendliness, they're pretty unparalleled. They have a location in Bay
                        City, too, and have a pretty good selection of drinks, wonderful PB&Js and cookies, and very cute merchandise.
                        It is one of the most popular spots, though - so expect some difficulty finding a seat or some time getting your
                        drink. It's a small price to pay if you're planning on sticking around to work, but their wifi can be a little
                        slow. I would by far and away recommend Live Oak for just sitting with someone and sipping, because their
                        seating and lighting is so comfortable. They also have a drive-through!</li>
                    <li><a href="https://thelochcoffee.co/"><b>The Loch Coffee</b></a>- oh, how the mighty have fallen. This used to
                        be my family's number one spot for a full two years before they opened a new location, got hit by financial
                        trouble, closed their original location, and their owner (Jimmy, who we were friends with), bailed on his business
                        to move to Denver. Their location is pretty bare in terms of decor and ambience, and their coffee has
                        absolutely fallen in quality from the best in Midland to one of the worst without good management. It does
                        remain the best place to get a fantastic, decadent, waffle, though. No drive through, not much parking, and 
                        an obviously apathetic and poorly cared for staff. It's right across from Espresso Milano!</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Espresso-Milano-120309501318293"><b>Espresso Milano</b></a> is an absolute Midland institution. It is the 
                        oldest locally owned coffee shop in Midland, and has managed to keep their cute, cozy downtown location through 
                        three MAJOR floods, many leasing cost increases (which killed Journey's, a LEGENDARY local cafe a block away), and 
                        COVID-19. They were best known for artistic events like open mics and poetry, and have decent coffee and 
                        wonderful affogatos. Their biggest pitfall is the lack of parking and space - they still aren't open for dine-in,
                        which all of their competitors have allowed. They have no drive-through, and their online presence is also
                        pretty outdated. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.mielementgrainsgrounds.com/"><b>Mi Element Grains and Grounds</b></a> is my newest
                        obsession. They're brand new, and trying to carve out a niche for themselves by offering homemade bread and 
                        beer in addition to coffee and pastries. Their decor and ambience is still a work in progress, and is pretty
                        bare, but they have the lowest prices out of everyone and my favorite mocha since Loch went downhill. Their is
                        plenty of seating but limited outlets for working people, they have a record player where you can pick
                        out music, and their owners have already given me free coffee and brownies and make their customers feel 
                        taken care of.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>My biggest takeaway from all of this is: if a coffee shop is being supplied their espresso by <a href="https://www.creationcoffee.co/">Creation Coffee</a>,
                    their espresso will be good. That's Live Oak, Loch, and Mi Element for sure - everything else is up to your
                    decor and ambience preferences.

            <h3>Nobody should be playing basketball.</h3>
            <author>Faye Kollig</author>
            <date>October 9, 2020</date>
            <p>I'm not a public school student in the age of COVID; I'm not a parent, 
                I'm not an educator, and I'm not an administrator. But I don't think you need to be any of those things
                to be made deeply uncomfortable by the way public elementary, middle, and high schools are handling 
                this situation.
            </p>
            <p>My boyfriend's little sister is a freshman at our local high school. Her mom put her in school full time,
                which means that she's wearing a mask for eight hours a day in class. I could get behind the idea that 
                responsibly executed schooling was worth the risk to provide a quality education to kids. But she is also
                an active, involved kid, which means she's in band, basketball, and volleyball. And none of those are
                cancelled or regulated.
            </p>
            <p>A week ago, she played a basketball game. She has games twice a week, two hours each, against other
                freshman teams from around the state. Nobody wears masks, and there is no communication between the coaches or
                the schools about the testing or precautions anyone is taking. At her game last week, one girl on the opposing
                team was COVID positive. That girl was too scared to tell her coach, but once she did, the coach did not
                tell the other coach or the other team. My boyfriend's little sister is quarantined now courtesy of 
                a message from a message from a notification. If her mom hadn't been in the right conversation at the right time,
                none of them would have any idea that the entire team was exposed in a contact sport without masks for 
                several hours to someone COVID positive.
            </p>
            <p>I don't think you need to be any kind of expert to see the problem. High school sports should absolutely
                be cancelled, regardless of how angry parents or students are. This kind of risk simply doesn't make sense.
                It takes students like my boyfriend's little sister out of school regularly as she self-isolates,
                it promotes an environment of fear and it puts my boyfriend's family at undue risk. I live in a conservative town,
                but coronavirus risk has no political orientation. The above average concentration of elderly individuals
                in our community poses an addtional complication, but the mental and physical wellbeing of students
                should have been enough.
